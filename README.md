## Why another openvpn script in place of contributing to the original ?

### Security

The reason of this other script is because installing openvpn by the repostiories downloads
a vulnerable version (2.5.1); at least by now. 

[CVE-2020-15078](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/CVE-2020-15078)

Affected Versions: 
	* 2.5.1 and lower, except 2.4.11

In the case your repos install a non-vulnerable ( at least publicly ) openvpn version, you can
stuck with angristan's script. If it's not like that you should check Openvpn-Wizard
